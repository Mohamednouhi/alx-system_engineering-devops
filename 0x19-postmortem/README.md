0x19-postmortem

Issue Summary:

Duration: The outage occurred from March 10, 2024, 10:00 PM to March 11, 2024, 2:00 AM (UTC).
Impact: The service experienced intermittent downtime, causing a slowdown in response times for approximately 30% of users. Users encountered difficulty accessing their accounts and performing transactions during this period.
Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was identified as a database deadlock issue, which occurred due to a misconfiguration in the database connection pool settings.

Timeline:

10:00 PM: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a spike in database errors.
10:05 PM: Engineering team notified of the issue.
10:10 PM: Initial investigation focused on database performance metrics.
10:30 PM: Assumed potential issues with database connections due to recent code deployment.
11:00 PM: Database administrators consulted to verify configurations.
11:30 PM: Misleading path pursued regarding network congestion.
12:00 AM: Issue escalated to senior engineering management.
12:30 AM: Database deadlock identified as the root cause.
1:00 AM: Emergency database configuration changes implemented.
2:00 AM: Service fully restored after database adjustments.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The issue stemmed from a misconfigured database connection pool, causing excessive connection attempts and eventual deadlocks. This led to degraded service performance and intermittent downtime. The problem was resolved by adjusting the database connection pool settings to optimize resource allocation and prevent deadlock situations.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Database Connection Pool Optimization: Implement automated scripts to monitor and adjust database connection pool settings based on workload demands.
Improved Monitoring: Enhance monitoring systems to provide real-time alerts for abnormal database behaviors, enabling rapid response to potential issues.
Documentation Update: Update documentation to include best practices for database connection pool configurations, ensuring consistency across deployments.
Training: Conduct training sessions for engineering teams on identifying and troubleshooting database performance issues to improve incident response capabilities.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Implement Automated Database Connection Pool Adjustments: Develop scripts to dynamically adjust database connection pool settings based on workload metrics.
Enhance Monitoring Alerts: Configure monitoring systems to generate alerts for abnormal database behaviors, such as deadlock incidents.
Update Documentation: Revise documentation to include recommended database connection pool configurations and troubleshooting procedures.
Training Sessions: Organize training sessions for engineering teams to improve proficiency in diagnosing and resolving database-related issues.
