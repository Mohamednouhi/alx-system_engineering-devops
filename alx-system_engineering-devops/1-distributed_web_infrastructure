-Why Additional Elements:
Server 2 (Replica): Adds redundancy and ensures continuous service if Server 1 fails.

Load Balancer (HAProxy): Distributes requests among servers for better performance.

Primary-Replica Database Cluster: Enhances data redundancy, scalability, and fault tolerance.

HTTPS and Firewall: Improve security.

Monitoring Tools: Track and address performance issues proactively.

-Load Balancer Algorithm:
Round-robin: Distributes requests sequentially to each server, promoting fair resource utilization.


-Active-Active Setup:
Active-Active: Both Server 1 and Server 2 actively handle requests, providing better performance and fault tolerance.


-Primary-Replica Database Cluster:
Primary Node: Handles write operations, ensuring data consistency for the application.

Replica Nodes: Handle read operations, providing scalability for read-intensive tasks and fault tolerance.


-Issues:
Single Points of Failure (SPOF):
Potential SPOF with Server 3 (Database). Consider adding more Replica nodes for fault tolerance.
Server 1 (Primary Web and Application Server) could be a SPOF if it fails.

Security Issues:
Implement a firewall to control traffic.
Deploy HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.

No Monitoring:
Lack of monitoring tools makes issue identification and resolution challenging. Implement monitoring solutions for better visibility.
